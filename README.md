# PituOS

PituOS is just a simple Operating System Kernel to play with.

Don't take it seriously, it's just a hobby, nothing stable or mature or safe.

Try it at your own risk!!

To try a simple boot printing a message:

make
make runsimpleboot

To try a second stage loader:

make
make bootwithsecond
